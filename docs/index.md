## Biography

My professional passion is to improve general human health and well-being through technological solutions.
As a generalist with many interests, I like to challenge myself in new application fields with a recent focus on bio-inspired computing in biomedical signal monitoring and I am looking forward to my next career challenge.
I thrive most in multi-disciplinary projects and I like to solve them in a multi-cultural harmonious team. 
I strongly believe that challenges of the future are best solved in a creative diverse team with good ethical standards.
